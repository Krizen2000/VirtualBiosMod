This virtual mod is not permament and if your new settings goes bad a power cycle will reset your settings to factory default.

It was tested only on Asus ROG STRIX G531GT 

This should work with any UEFI bios regardless the operating system, if you have Clover booloader put the VirtualBioosMod.efi in drivers and reboot
If your booloader does not know how to load efi drivers put the VirtualBioosMod.efi on a fat32 usb stick and create in your bios a new boot entry and point to VirtualBioosMod.efi file.
Put the new entry as first boot and the second boot put OS which want to boot after exit from VirtualBioosMod.efi app

Have fun!
